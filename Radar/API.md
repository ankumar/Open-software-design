## Design

[Werner Vogelâ€™s 6 Rules for Good API Design](https://thenewstack.io/werner-vogels-6-rules-for-good-api-design/)
1. APIs are Forever
2. Never Break Backward Compatibility
3. Work Backwards from Customer Use Cases
4. Create APIs That are Self Describing and Have a Clear, Specific Purpose
5. Create APIs with Explicit and Well-Documented Failure Modes
6. Avoid Leaking Implementation Details at All Costs
