#### Perspectives

**Cycles**

> History only rhymes, and unlike productivity software, SaaS is not a single horizontal market. But there are some big clusters that seem ripe for consolidation, as well as across verticals. **ERP** in fact was an early example of functional consolidation, one that started in manufacturing and spread to other industries. The question for SaaS Universe™ inhabitants is are you a **consolidator or the consolidated?** -- https://www.platformonomics.com/2021/05/saas-sprawl-and-the-potential-for-market-consolidation/

[Is the modern analytics stack unbundling, or consolidating?](https://sisudata.com/blog/modern-analytics-stack)

**API's**

> "Over the past decade we have seen nearly every industry unlock innovation at scale through a single platform API that abstracts away the historical complexities inherent to that industry. **Twilio** for communications, **Stripe** for payments, **Plaid** for financial records, **Segment** for customer records, and now Mapped for IoT." -- https://blog.mapped.com/ 

**"Open"**

> “Open standards are the best way to make sure that everybody in the industry is involved in setting the direction of technology in our industry.” --https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/09/why-major-fintech-players-are-already-embracing-open-api-standards-vb-live/

> Open protocols backed by proprietary implementations is the future of managed services. -- https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1428411566307766272

> Circa 2008 on Open Source vs Open Standards [1] & lack of portability between SaaS [2]
> Which one is more important open source or open standards? According to Opera Software's CEO Jon S. von Tetzchner it's open standards. A lot of people seem to agree:
> "open standards ARE more important than the licensing of an individual piece of software. Who cares what license the software someone uses is, as long as its always possible to replace it, and freely compete, which a free and open standard ensures."
> I disagree and I'm starting to feel like a lone voice here, maybe I'm wrong? Well let's go through my reasoning. I happen to agree with Bob Suter that "the easy availability of software can accelerate the adoption of a standard" and that adoption makes something a standard or not. For me, the fastest way of achieving such adoption is through providing an operational means of implementing an open standard - which means open source. So in my view, if you want portability you will need **BOTH open standards AND open source. BOTH are important**.

**Boost**

> Our mission is to create a community-driven suite of extensible building blocks for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) builders. Our goal is to foster an open environment for developing and sharing reusable code that accelerates the ability to deliver and operate multi-tenant SaaS solutions on AWS. -- AWS SaaS Boost, https://aws.amazon.com/partners/saas-boost/ 

> One slide which says it all. Before anyone goes "serverless is the future" ... no, "serverless is the norm" - it's just that so many are yet to realise this. Give it time, another five years or so -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1412001525191356418

### Build vs Buy

> Apply appropriate purchasing methods. There is no magic one size fits all. Hence you break into small contracts with components that are similar (in terms of evolution). Don't mix commodity with genesis unless you like massive change control cost overruns. -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/971029206510563328

> In mapping terms, you want to be winning in the orange (good) areas and extracting yourself from the blue (legacy and new legacy) areas. -- https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1428478888401936395

> And if something is not your core domain, why are you wasting time and money (extensively) customizing software (or SaaS for that matter). It's rare that you win the marketplace because you have the best payroll processes.
> Use generic processes that are supported by COTS/SaaS.-- https://twitter.com/crichardson/status/1422967303885389824

### **Enterprise**
> Developing and running transformative applications in the cloud requires innovative technology, infrastructure, and services. It also requires a foundation of trust and stability, so organizations have the confidence to make long-term investments on our platform. -- https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis
