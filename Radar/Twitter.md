* [The gap is widening, and there is no easy path to catch up. It's not for lack of technology, so there is no magic solution to buy. The necessary competence resides in product companies, so consultants is not the solution. We need to find new ways to collaborate](https://twitter.com/lalleal/status/1386411136199790592)
* [Instead of amplifying the constant whining about how everything is broken, we should be encouraging people to learn how to navigate ambiguity and mess. Software isn’t perfect, won’t ever be perfect, and perhaps isn’t meant to be perfect. Let’s learn how to better deal with it. Not to be confused with learning how to survive in toxic or dysfunctional workplaces. That’s different. Felt I had to say it, because inevitably someone will be in my mentions talking about how some things can’t be fixed and it’s better to cut your losses soon.](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1416095406610554880)

* [At the end of the day there wasn't one way to DevOps. The only real requirement was to be intentional about your engineering culture and continuously work to improve it.](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1473370398498693120)
* [The CAP theorem of service APIs. You get functionality earlier, and eventual consistency later, because development teams are partitioned.](https://twitter.com/adrianco/status/1466463836349763585)
* [Software works at scale when it’s as simple as possible. Every click is friction. Every new mental model is friction. Every component of pricing is friction. Every question of trust or security is friction. Whatever you choose to build, the simplest software usually wins.](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1474155830777843712)
