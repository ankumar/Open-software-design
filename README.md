# Open software design

> Open-source software has made it easier for software developers to study and learn programming by looking at real-world working software. But what about software design? Building architects (not software) study thousands of buildings in their training and career. Software developers, in contrast, only study a handful of other large software designs. This means we repeat mistakes that we would have been able to avoid, should we be able to learn from others.
> Open software design is the idea that software design must be available for public use. It's the idea that we should Work with the garage door up. The main audience of the design is developers who built the software, and not external people. The contents are living artefacts, they naturally evolve as the software evolve. In the world where the majority of large real-world programs are closed-source, opening up our software design documentation is the least we can do to contribute back to the community.

The necessary competence resides in product companies, so consultants is not the solution. We need to find new ways to collaborate](https://twitter.com/lalleal/status/1386411136199790592)
* [Instead of amplifying the constant whining about how everything is broken, we should be encouraging people to learn how to navigate ambiguity and mess. Software isn’t perfect, won’t ever be perfect, and perhaps isn’t meant to be perfect. Let’s learn how to better deal with it. Not to be confused with learning how to survive in toxic or dysfunctional workplaces. That’s different. Felt I had to say it, because inevitably someone will be in my mentions talking about how some things can’t be fixed and it’s better to cut your losses soon.](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1416095406610554880)
