## Open software design

> Open-source software has made it easier for software developers to study and learn programming by looking at real-world working software. But what about software design? Building architects (not software) study thousands of buildings in their training and career. Software developers, in contrast, only study a handful of other large software designs. This means we repeat mistakes that we would have been able to avoid, should we be able to learn from others.

> Open software design is the idea that software design must be available for public use. It's the idea that we should Work with the garage door up. The main audience of the design is developers who built the software, and not external people. The contents are living artefacts, they naturally evolve as the software evolve. In the world where the majority of large real-world programs are closed-source, opening up our software design documentation is the least we can do to contribute back to the community.

> The biggest lesson I’ve learned is that, once you empower people, giving them an environment in which to succeed, and recognise their successes, they will rapidly, and as a collective, start thinking about things which haven’t even crossed your mind. That’s the real benefit of this kind of approach: access to the collective intelligence of the many, over reliance on the much more restricted intelligence of the few.

> Good (but long) writeup on "why Temporal" from their Head of Developer Experience, Shawn Wang (aka Swyx).
> I've been following this guy for a while as he's been very vocal about learning in public and helped push a lot of folks (including myself) to tackle fun projects to learn new technologies while teaching others. I was very excited to see he joined Temporal! https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/

>> swyx has, presumably by happenstance, happened to show up on a number of podcasts i've been monitoring.  i agree that he's got a very refreshing take on how to learn, how to grow, and he's got a great story backing up his philosophy given his transition from finance to software. Quinn, Henry - this is actually a really great article (i'm perusing it) that i hadn't run into before.  i think it'd be a great thing to share on the blast i did in general, just to whet people's appetites for what's motivating us to do this kind of exploration in the first place
