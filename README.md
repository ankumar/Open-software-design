> **The ideal state of visual application logic.**
> * What if complex application logic were easier to understand? What if undesirable states and transitions were made impossible, and entire classes of bugs eliminated? And what if it could be visualized, and even visually edited?
>
> * That's the power of visual modeling – from visualization, simulation, analysis, autogeneration of tests, documentation, and diagrams, to collaboration with designers and others, make your code do more. 
>
> Our mission is to make app logic accessible to the entire team, including developers, designers, and stakeholders. Using state machines and statecharts as a common visual language, the software development cycle becomes more collaborative, eliminating handoff and tightening the feedback loop.

> I've been following this guy for a while as he's been very vocal about learning in public and helped push a lot of folks (including myself) to tackle fun projects to learn new technologies while teaching others. I was very excited to see he joined Temporal! https://www.swyx.io/why-temporal/

>> swyx has, presumably by happenstance, happened to show up on a number of podcasts i've been monitoring.  i agree that he's got a very refreshing take on how to learn, how to grow, and he's got a great story backing up his philosophy given his transition from finance to software. Quinn, Henry - this is actually a really great article (i'm perusing it) that i hadn't run into before.  i think it'd be a great thing to share on the blast i did in general, just to whet people's appetites for what's motivating us to do this kind of exploration in the first place
