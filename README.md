> **The ideal state of visual application logic.**
> * What if complex application logic were easier to understand? What if undesirable states and transitions were made impossible, and entire classes of bugs eliminated? And what if it could be visualized, and even visually edited?
>
> * That's the power of visual modeling â€“ from visualization, simulation, analysis, autogeneration of tests, documentation, and diagrams, to collaboration with designers and others, make your code do more. 
>
> Our mission is to make app logic accessible to the entire team, including developers, designers, and stakeholders. Using state machines and statecharts as a common visual language, the software development cycle becomes more collaborative, eliminating handoff and tightening the feedback loop.
