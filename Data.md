## Data

> "For the longest time, we fixated on cycles, making things work fasterâ€”the processors, CPUs, GPUs, and more parallel servers. We ignored the data part. Now we have to fixate on data." -- https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/27/1037134/data-science-challenges-trustworthy-ai/

> "the teams that produce data are decoupled from the downstream analytics and ML use cases. Likewise, the people dealing with analytics use cases are typically unaware of operational systems that produce the data" -- https://m.subbu.org/broken-state-of-data-4c8a8a30a0c3

> Organizations have vast amounts of confidential data locked down due to privacy concerns. Opaque Systems makes confidential data useful by enabling secure analytics and machine learning on encrypted data that comes from one or more sources.
With Opaque Systems, organizations can analyze encrypted data in the cloud using popular tools like Apache Spark, while ensuring that their data is never exposed unencrypted to the cloud provider. -- https://opaque.co/

> Confidential computing is most commonly used in financial services and health care industries and by government agencies, but every industry can benefit from it. -- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/#customer-stories
